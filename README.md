# Getting Started
## üìã Prerequisites

<p align="justify">If you already have Node.js and npm, ensure that you update them before trying to construct the images. To run the project, you'll need <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download">Node.js</a>, <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm">npm</a> and <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">git</a> installed on your machine. Make certain that all four are installed.</p>

## Installation
<p align="justify">You can obtain the project by using the command <code>git clone https://github.com/Arquisoft/lomap_es2b</code>.</p>

### With Docker
<p align="justify">The most efficient method to initiate everything is by using Docker:</p>

```sh
docker-compose up --build
```
<p align="justify">Two docker images will be generated for the webapp and the restapi since they are not currently present on your system.</p>

### Without Docker
<p align="justify">Compile and run the restapi:</p>

```shell
cd restapi
npm install
npm start
```

<p align="justify">Now the webapp:</p>

```shell
cd webapp
npm install
npm start
```

You should be able to access the application in [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
