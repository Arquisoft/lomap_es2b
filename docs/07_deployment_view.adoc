== Deployment View

=== Infrastructure

Describe (usually in a combination of diagrams, tables, and text):

*  the distribution of your system to multiple locations, environments, computers, processors, .. as well as the physical connections between them
*  important justification or motivation for this deployment structure
* Quality and/or performance features of the infrastructure
*  the mapping of software artifacts to elements of the infrastructure

For multiple environments or alternative deployments please copy that section of arc42 for all relevant environments.

Motivation::

This diagram shows is a basic overview of how our application will be deployed. It will be updated in the future as the development process goes aÂ¡on and we take more detailed decisions.

Quality and/or Performance Features::

As one of our key quality goals is to have a fast and efficient application, we tried to make the simplest arquitecture posible and using fast and reliable third party services.

Mapping of Building Blocks to Infrastructure::

|===
| Node | Description

| Browser
| The client side application the user will use to connect to our application.
| WebServer
| This is where both our frontend and backend applications will be stored. The frontend will be served to the user and it will send requests to the backend.
| WebApp
| This is the frontend application that the user will receive and interact with through the browser.
| RestAPI
| It will be used to store images from user markers
| Mapbox
| To display the user markers we will use Mapbox as the map provider.
| PodProvider
| This is the third party service where our users' SOLID PODs will be stored
| User_Pod
| This is the SOLID POD where users' personal data will be stored and read by the WebApp.
