== Architecture Constraints


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Any requirement that constrains software architects in their freedom of design and implementation decisions or decision about the development process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and are valid for whole organizations and companies.

.Motivation
Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design decisions and where they must adhere to constraints.
Constraints must always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

.Form
Simple tables of constraints with explanations.
If needed you can subdivide them into
technical constraints, organizational and political constraints and
conventions (e.g. programming or versioning guidelines, documentation or naming conventions)

=== Tecnichal Constraints
|===
| Constraint | Explanation

| React
| The React framework will be used to create the web based UI (User Interface).
| Typescript
| TypeScript is a strongly typed version of JavaScript. We will use it to make development easier and to be able to detect typing errors during compilation.
| SOLID
| We will use SOLID as a way to have a decentralized storage of our users data.
| Git/GitHub
| Git will be used as a version control system and Github will be the platform where the remote repository is store. All the documentation of the development process will be stored in GitHub as well.
|===
=== Organizational Constraints
|===
| Constraint | Explanation

| Team meetings
| We must hold at least one meeting a week. This will be done in the weekly laboratory session. Extra meetings may be hold when necessary.
| Deadlines
| As this project is part of a college course, it has very tight and fixed deadlines. This means we may have trouble delivering all releseases with the desired quality.
| Application interoperability
| It is desirable that the different groups agree on a common storage standard for the SOLID part of the application. This, however, is not mandatory as it can be difficult to coordinate those many groups.
|===
=== Conventions
|===
| Constraint | Explanation

| Arc42 Documentation
| We will follow the Arc42 template for the documentation of the project.
| JavaScript/TypeScript
| We will use JavaScript/TypeScript naming conventions.
| MVC
| We will follow MVC naming and layering conventions.
| SOLID
| We will follow the SOLID specification in order to ensure our users data is kept private and under their control.
