|*Knowledge of SOLID*
| SOLID is a new technology for the whole group that we have never used and therefore certain problems may arise when using it. Also, it is not very easy to find good examples on the Internet..
| Understand the technology before using it by looking for documentation and tutorials so as not to have problems when we are implementing it.


|*Time*
|Due to the fact that there are many works by other subjects in this semester, it may be difficult for us to reach a delivery date.
| We must make an effort to organize the time we have and carry out good planning.

|*Github*
| Despite the fact that we have used Git and Github in other subjects, our knowledge is basic and problems can arise, such as knowing how to create a pull request or delete information due to a merge.
|Github is a basic technology that we must learn to use in order to work in the future and we can do it through examples or making small project prototypes to familiarize ourselves with it.
