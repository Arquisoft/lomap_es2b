| Map | Map of the city
| Marker | Location marker with the information

=== Gaphical user interface
To develop the user interface we are going to use the REACT library together with TypeScript. We are going to use REACT since it seems to us the most appropriate because it is based on components. The user interface should be intuitive, clean and simple to make it easier for the user to use the web, and only worry about looking for personalized maps about the city.

=== Internationalization
After having been talking, we have decided that both the documentation and the application are going to be done in English. This will be so because we want the application to be more international.

=== Security
Regarding security, we will follow the SOLID principles and will use the PODs to gain access. As we use the POD API we can verify the user and only access the data that he allows. In our case we will only store the username without the need to store the password.
