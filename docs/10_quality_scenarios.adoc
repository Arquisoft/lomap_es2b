|Usage scenarios
|Priority


| Privacy 
| User data must be protected and it must also be done in a decentralized way 
| Data from users will be retrieved in a decentralized way, from the userâ€™s pod. For this we will use different pod providers such as INRUPT and SOLID. All information related to personal bookmarks will be stored in the pods.
| High

| Usability 
| In order for the page to stand out from the rest and to be easy to use and understand, it has to be usable.
| When a user wants to perform any action in Lomap, they will do so without any complications with the help of the interface 
| High


| Security 
| The page has to be very secure to protect user data, because if it were insecure no user would use it.
| Data must not be accessible for any third parties. Data from users will be stored in a secure system.
| High

| Testability 
| The unit tests are necessary to check the correct implementation of the application.
| For this, the developers implement tests, in order to detect why the app was failing, so that funcionality is fixed as soon as possible.
| Medium

| Portability
| Today web page users use many different devices such as phones, computers. Therefore, we want to make the application portable to reach the maximum number of users.
| We will try to make the page as comfortable as possible for different devices, making it more adaptable, usable...
