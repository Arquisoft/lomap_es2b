|Quality Goal|Quality Scenario|Priority
| Privacy | Protection of end-user data in order to carry out the decentralization of personal data and thereby improve the level of privacy of users with the use of personal pods. | High
| Usability | The system should be able to be used quickly and easily for 90% of the users in less than 3 minutes. | High
| Decentralization | To avoid security problems by having all the data in a central base, the personalized maps will be under the control of the users and the shared information will be stored in the personal pod of each one| High
| Interoperability | Capacity of the information system and the procedures it supports, to share data and enable the exchange of information and knowledge between them.| Medium
| Scalability | LoMap must be able to grow and increase its functionalities in a simple way without making changes without making changes to the other finished parts| Medium
